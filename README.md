# 📊 Notendurchschnitt & Status (C++)

## 📘 About the Project
A simple yet practical **C++ console application** that calculates the **average grade** and determines the student's **status** (e.g., *Pass/Fail* or *Approved/Not Approved*) based on the final result.

This project focuses on applying fundamental programming concepts, including:
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Input validation
- Functions
- Basic arithmetic calculations

## 🛠️ Built With
- C++
- 
## 🎮 How It Works (Logic)
The program:
1. Takes grades as input
2. Computes the average
3. Checks rules/thresholds
4. Prints the final status

## ✅ What I Practiced
- Taking multiple inputs and validating them
- Calculating averages with clean arithmetic
- Using conditions to determine the final status
- Organizing the solution into small functions
- Printing clear, user-friendly output in the console

## 📌 Notes
This is a learning project written as part of my C++ practice journey.
